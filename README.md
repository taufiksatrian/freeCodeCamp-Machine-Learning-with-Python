Machine learning has many practical applications that you can use in your projects or on the job.

In the Machine Learning with Python Certification, you'll use the TensorFlow framework to build several neural networks and explore more advanced techniques like natural language processing and reinforcement learning.

You'll also dive into neural networks, and learn the principles behind how deep, recurrent, and convolutional neural networks work.

### Tensorflow
TensorFlow is an open source framework that makes machine learning and neural networking easier to use.

The following video course was created by Tim Ruscica, also known as “Tech With Tim”. It will help you to understand TensorFlow and some of its powerful capabilities.
